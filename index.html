      <h1>Introduction</h1>
      <p>I am a recent design graduate of Georgia Tech looking to improve my 
        coding skills.</p>
      <h1>Where I'm From</h1>
      <p>Dublin, Georgia</p>
      <h1>What are your favorite hobbies?</h1>
      <p>I enjoy hiking, gaming, and craft projects.</p>
      <h1>What's your dream job?</h1>
      <p>I would love to work in video games as a designer.</p>
      <h1>Where do you live?</h1>
      <p>Currently I'm living in East Tennessee.</p>
      <h1>Why do you want to be a web developer?</h1>
      <p>With my B.S. in Industrial Design I gained a lot of background in UI/UX design. 
        What I hope to gain from this certificate is to actually be able to implement my 
        designs into a working product.
